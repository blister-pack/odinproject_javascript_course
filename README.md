# odinproject_javascript_course
After taking a backend development course and learning about Django (Python) I found myself often trying to do things that would be a lot easier to do if I had some Javascript knowledge. This inspired me to continue my education and get into the frontend. By learning Javascript and at least React I think my web dev skills will improve significantly
I might also use this as a dev blog to track progress and celebrate any important achievements to keep me going.
This might be a good way of also letting other people know how my progress went if they are interested.
