# odinproject_javascript_course
After taking a backend development course and learning about Django (Python) I found myself often trying to do things that would be a lot easier to do if I had some Javascript knowledge. This inspired me to continue my education and get into the frontend. By learning Javascript and at least React I think my web dev skills will improve significantly
I might also use this as a dev blog to track progress and celebrate any important achievements to keep me going.
This might be a good way of also letting other people know how my progress went if they are interested.

- Started this repo. Haven't interacted with JavaScript yet but I'm hoping I can review some basics on HTML and CSS.

- Starting today w/ html boilerplate. The foundations course isn't too exciting so far.
- After playing around with html and diving deeper than I had before, I'm starting to wonder why Django was so complicated regarding urlpattens...
