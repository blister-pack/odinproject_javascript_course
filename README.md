# odinproject_javascript_course
After taking a backend development course and learning about Django (Python) I found myself often trying to do things that would be a lot easier to do if I had some Javascript knowledge. This inspired me to continue my education and get into the frontend. By learning Javascript and at least React I think my web dev skills will improve significantly
I might also use this as a dev blog to track progress and celebrate any important achievements to keep me going.
This might be a good way of also letting other people know how my progress went if they are interested.

-- 21/02/2024 --
- Started this repo. Haven't interacted with JavaScript yet but I'm hoping I can review some basics on HTML and CSS.

-- 22/02/2024
- Starting today w/ html boilerplate. The foundations course isn't too exciting so far.
- After playing around with html and diving deeper than I had before, I'm starting to wonder why Django was so complicated regarding urlpattens...

-- 23/02/2024
- Doing some CSS exercises today

-- 24/02/2024
- Felt a little tired so I only finished my CSS exercises

--25/02/2024
- Feeling tired again... I finished the cascade exercise and will see what
else I can accomplish today.
- Learned how to inspect and went through the google lesson to understand how
to use the browser dev tools

--26/02/2024
- Starting the day with the box model lesson.

--27/02/2024

--28/02/2024

- Getting started on Flexbox

--29/02/2024
- Continuation of studies
- Got started on the first flexbox exercise but I am struggling with it

--03/03/2024
- Had a small break to do some hiking, hit the gym and get my head in the
right place.
- Will continue with the flexbox exercises and see how that goes.

--04/03/2024
- Spent most of the day applying to jobs. Still wanted to program here.

--05/03/2024
- Applications, 20 min of study. Better than nothing I guess

--06/03/2024
- Sent some applications again

--10/03/2024

--11/03/2024
- Continuation of exercises, these flex exercises are surprisingly challenging. I wish I could say I was having an easy time this early in the journey
- Completed flex 5 exercise
- Completed flex 6 exercise
- Started flex 7 exercise

--12/03/2024
- Spent a lot of time replying to some questions from a company I applied to

--13/03/2024
- Finished final flex exercise. And it took a while and I found it quite difficult. Ouch. I do feel like started to understand flexbox better, however. How and when to use containers and how flex-wrap can change the way a page looks. It was hard but it was rewarding.

--14/03/2024
- Starting the homepage project of the foundations course
- Good progress on the project, exercises definitely paid off, but this will surely take a few hours. Especially to make it look good, not just putting things in the right place.

--15/03/2024
- Back at it again. Trying to focus on getting things in the right place first. Then I'll take care of the style. Probably works out better that way

--19/03/2024
- A little study session. Had a career fair today and some administrative trouble with the german overlords.

--20/03/2024
- Career fair final day. Trying to figure out how to align the quote items adequately. I'm having the most trouble with this. I just figured it out and in the process I figured out that I might be an idiot.
