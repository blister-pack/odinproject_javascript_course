# odinproject_javascript_course
After taking a backend development course and learning about Django (Python) I found myself often trying to do things that would be a lot easier to do if I had some Javascript knowledge. This inspired me to continue my education and get into the frontend. By learning Javascript and at least React I think my web dev skills will improve significantly
I might also use this as a dev blog to track progress and celebrate any important achievements to keep me going.
This might be a good way of also letting other people know how my progress went if they are interested.

-- 21/02/2024 --
- Started this repo. Haven't interacted with JavaScript yet but I'm hoping I can review some basics on HTML and CSS.

-- 22/02/2024
- Starting today w/ html boilerplate. The foundations course isn't too exciting so far.
- After playing around with html and diving deeper than I had before, I'm starting to wonder why Django was so complicated regarding urlpattens...

-- 23/02/2024
- Doing some CSS exercises today

-- 24/02/2024
- Felt a little tired so I only finished my CSS exercises

--25/02/2024
- Feeling tired again... I finished the cascade exercise and will see what
else I can accomplish today.
- Learned how to inspect and went through the google lesson to understand how
to use the browser dev tools

--26/02/2024
- Starting the day with the box model lesson.

--27/02/2024
- Late lesson today, margin and padding exercises
- Finished 1st exercise on padding

--28/02/2024
- Keep going on the CSS exercises; finished margin and padding exercises
- Getting started on Flexbox

--29/02/2024
- Continuation of studies
- Got started on the first flexbox exercise but I am struggling with it

--03/03/2024
- Had a small break to do some hiking, hit the gym and get my head in the
right place.
- Will continue with the flexbox exercises and see how that goes.

--04/03/2024
- Spent most of the day applying to jobs. Still wanted to program here.

--05/03/2024
- Applications, 20 min of study. Better than nothing I guess

--06/03/2024
- Sent some applications again
- Finished flex 2 (finally) and started 3

--07/03/2024
- Gonna try to finish the flex exercises today, maybe make some applications
later.
- Finished exercise 3 (flex)
- Finished exercise 4 (flex)

--08/03/2024
- Relaxing day

--09/03/2024
- Studied German today

--10/03/2024
- Continuation of exercises
- Exercise flex 5 progress

--11/03/2024
- Continuation of exercises, these flex exercises are surprisingly challenging. I wish I could say I was having an easy time this early in the journey
- Completed flex 5 exercise
- Completed flex 6 exercise
- Started flex 7 exercise

--12/03/2024
- Spent a lot of time replying to some questions from a company I applied to

--13/03/2024
- Finished final flex exercise. And it took a while and I found it quite difficult. Ouch. I do feel like started to understand flexbox better, however. How and when to use containers and how flex-wrap can change the way a page looks. It was hard but it was rewarding.

--14/03/2024
- Starting the homepage project of the foundations course
- Good progress on the project, exercises definitely paid off, but this will surely take a few hours. Especially to make it look good, not just putting things in the right place.

--15/03/2024
- Back at it again. Trying to focus on getting things in the right place first. Then I'll take care of the style. Probably works out better that way

--19/03/2024
- A little study session. Had a career fair today and some administrative trouble with the german overlords.

--20/03/2024
- Career fair final day. Trying to figure out how to align the quote items adequately. I'm having the most trouble with this. I just figured it out and in the process I figured out that I might be an idiot.
- Managed to get the quote looking decent.
- The call to action does not look great, but it looks in the right place
- When things shrink too much they start looking out of place - I think I need to set minimum content size values so they don't get off the right place

--21/03/2024
- Hope I can do some more palpable progress in the homepage project. I think I'll start by checking out some colors. I'll also need some potato pics.
- I'll create a todo list because I often get distracted finding things that need to get done instead of finishing section by section. It's harder to measure progress the way I'm doing it and it also feels like I'm going slowly. Possibly because it's not effective to jump from task to task.
- I'd love to publish this project on LinkedIn soon, it should look good for such a purpose.
- Used a color palette generator to figure out what colors to use
- Also used a gradient creator that I learned how to use during the DCI starter course
- Resized a lot of things. Tried making things lot better by making the elements more central. The color palette is well defined. Used some new pictures that look good in the website. Just need to tune some of the homepage things and it should be done! yay

--22/03/2024
- Website seems almost done. Need to resize some of the elements and take care that they flex adequately. Hopefully this will be done today and I will be able to deploy. Let's see.
- Apparently using the height property in the container that is supposed to wrap messes up the wrap somehow and I cannot define the containers height that way. The images would get cut. So instead I have to define the height of the image containers. And it only took me about 1.5 hours to figure it out. Great :)
- Also solved the problem with the spacing between the thumbnails. Apparently the flex property was making the cards expand and keeping me from resizing as I wished to. Took me a while to figure it out.
- Don't really understand the difference between min-height and height in the body defined through CSS

--23/03/2024
- Published my website
- Got started on Javascript. What a weird programming language.

--24/03/2024
- Continuation of the Javascript studies.
- Completed the lesson on operators. Not much of a difference from python

--25/03/2024
- JS Data types and Conditionals

--26/03/2024
- Continuation of last lesson

--27/03/2024
- Same as yesterday. There's so much reading to do.
